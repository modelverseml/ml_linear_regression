"""Automated backward feature selection.

Removes one feature at a time until every remaining feature is both
statistically significant (p-value <= 0.05) and not collinear with the rest
(VIF <= 10). At each step it drops the single "worst" feature:

    - both checks violated : drop the highest VIF (ties broken by p-value)
    - only p-values too high: drop the largest p-value
    - only VIFs too high    : drop the largest VIF

This automates the manual workflow from the README's Multicollinearity and
Hypothesis Testing sections.
